# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Challenge 3 for Bootcamp in front end web-development and UX.
## Introduction

For the University of Birmingham bootcamp's third challenge in front-end web development and UX, I created a portfolio using Bootstrap. I also used a bit of javascript for dynamic movement within the page. I read alot of material online to be able to put this together. This portfolio serves as a showcase for my projects and will be a helpful tool as I start my job search in the tech industry.


## Requirements
To successfully complete this challenge, I adhered to the guidelines that required the page to dynamically display my name, a recent photo, and navigation links to sections about me, my work, skills, and contact details upon loading. The webpage also needed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices, and feature essential components such as a jumbotron, navbar, and footer.
This challenge reinforced everything we learnt about Bootstrap and responsive design. I encountered a few hiccups along the way, but with a little reserch everything came together in the end. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This portfolio webpage, while maintaining an unassuming simplicity, offers a seamless user experience. Upon opening the page in your browser, the navigation bar provides clickable links that seamlessly guide you to the main sections of the site. Although, the about tab refused to work but I will debug that as I develop and refactor the site.

Currently, the section dedicated to showcasing my projects is undergoing development as the screenshot of my works do not perfectly fit into the place holders. In its final iteration, it will feature interactive each image will link to its respective live project. Presently, these images serve as placeholders, redirecting to the same location.

In the "Contact links" section, i am yet to hyperlink to my Instagram, Linkedn, and github. Also below at the footer section, I am yet to link facebook,twitter and instagram icons. For future inclusion, i will incorporate a placeholder for my contact details and email address.
Finally, i am yet to style the logo icon to fit into the navbar.
